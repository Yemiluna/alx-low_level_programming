# Hello, World

Project done during **ALX Software Engineering studies** at **ALX Software Engineering**.
It aims to learn about what is entry point, basics commands (puts, printf, putchar), compilation process with gcc in **C language**.

## Technologies
* Scripts written in Bash 4.3.11(1)
* C files are compiled using `gcc 4.8.4`
* Tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

## Projects
All of the following folders are projects done during the studies:

| File name | Description |
| ------------ | ----------- |
| [`0-preprocessor`](https://github.com/Yemiluna/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x00-hello_world/0-preprocessor) | Runs a C file through the preprocessor and saves the result into another file |
| [`1-compiler`](https://github.com/Yemiluna/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x00-hello_world/1-compiler) | Compiles a C file but does not link |
| [`2-assembler`](https://github.com/Yemiluna/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x00-hello_world/2-assembler) | Generates the assembly code of a C code and saves it in an output file |
| [`3-name`](https://github.com/Yemiluna/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x00-hello_world/3-name) | Compiles a C file and creates an executable named cisfun |
| [`4-puts.c`](https://github.com/Yemiluna/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x00-hello_world/4-puts.c) | Prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle" |
| [`5-printf.c`](https://github.com/Yemiluna/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x00-hello_world/5-printf.c) | Prints exactly with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art |
| [`6-size.c`](https://github.com/Yemiluna/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x00-hello_world/6-size.c) | Prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled |
| [`100-intel`](https://github.com/Yemiluna/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x00-hello_world/100-intel) | Generates the assembly code (Intel syntax) of a C code and save it in an output file |
| [`101-quote.c`](https://github.com/Yemiluna/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x00-hello_world/101-quote.c) | Prints exactly and that piece of art is useful" - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19 |
