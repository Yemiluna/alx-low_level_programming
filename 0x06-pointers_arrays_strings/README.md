# More pointers, arrays and strings
Project done during at **ALX Software Engineering studies**. It aims to learn about pointers and arrays in **C language**.

## Technologies
* C files are compiled using gcc 4.8.4
* C files are written according to the C90 standard
* Tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

## Files
All of the following files are programs written in C:
