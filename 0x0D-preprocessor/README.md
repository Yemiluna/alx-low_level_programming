# Preprocessor

Project done during **ALX Software Engineering studies** at **ALX Software Engineering**.
It aims to learn about how to include guard in the header files and macros in **C language**.

## Technologies
* C files are written according to the C90 standard
* C files are compiled using `gcc 4.8.4`
* Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

## Files
All of the following files are programs written in C:

| File name | Description |
| ------------ | ----------- |
| [``](https://github.com/Yemiluna/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x0D-preprocessor/) | Takes a pointer to an int as parameter and updates the value it points to 98 |
| [``](https://github.com/Yemiluna/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x0D-preprocessor/) | Swaps the values of two integers |
| [``](https://github.com/Yemiluna/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x0D-preprocessor/) | Returns the length of a string |
| [``](https://github.com/Yemiluna/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x0D-preprocessor/) | Prints a string to stdout |
| [``](https://github.com/Yemiluna/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x0D-preprocessor/) | Prints a string, in reverse |
| [``](https://github.com/Yemiluna/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x0D-preprocessor/) | Reverses a string |
