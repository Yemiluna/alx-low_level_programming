# Debugging

Project done during **ALX Software Engineering studies** at **ALX Software Engineering**.
It aims to learn how to debug in **C language**.

## Technologies
* C files are written according to the C90 standard
* C files are compiled using `gcc 4.8.4`
* Tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

## Files
All of the following files are programs written in C:

| File name | Description |
| ------------ | ----------- |
| [`0-main.c`](https://github.com/Yemiluna/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x03-debugging/0-main.c) | Test that function positive_or_negative() gives the correct output when given a case of 0 |
| [`1-main.c`](https://github.com/Yemiluna/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x03-debugging/1-main.c) | Fixed program to the infinite loop |
| [`2-largest_number.c`](https://github.com/Yemiluna/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x03-debugging/2-largest_number.c) | Prints the largest of three integers |
| [`3-print_remaining_days.c`](https://github.com/Yemiluna/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x03-debugging/3-print_remaining_days.c) | Converts a date to the day of year and determines how many days are left in the year |
| [`holberton.h`](https://github.com/Yemiluna/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x03-debugging/holberton.h) | Header file |
